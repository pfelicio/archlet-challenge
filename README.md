> Archlet fullstack developer coding challenge.

## The Challenge

Write a simple version of the [game of life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) with the stack ES6+JSX, React and Redux.

This challenge should take you a couple of hours and your are free to choose which feature to implement. There is no time pressure. Just notify us by email when you are done.

We are going to look at your code in terms of simplicity, structure and style. This includes how the commits are structured and what the commit message style looks like.

Please also write an imaginary todo list in this repository of what could be changed or added in the future.

If you want to, then you could also implement unit tests and try to make it as performant as possible - fancy optimization tricks - let your mind free.
